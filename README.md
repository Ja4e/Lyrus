# cmus-mpd lyric player
featuring fully fledged cmus, mpd lyric player
automatic lyrics fetcher
supports wide range of lyric sources
ncurses, scrollable

do use lyrics10.py file

cmus mainly and it works flawlessly mind you there uhh can be small bugs because of external library used

I will implement dynamic refresh so you dont need to adjust that annoying delays whatsover
best cmus simple lyrics player out there

Scrollable lyrics btw 

also has inbuilt txt auto scroller (might need to revamp it to be more dynamic to wrapped line count but still very useable)
very customizeable
