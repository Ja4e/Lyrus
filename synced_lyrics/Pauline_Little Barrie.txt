Pauline
You’re the unforgotten dream
The one cancels out the sea
Of faceless souls in front of me
Pauline
It’s wrong
My own good nature let me down
Picture memory stitched me up
Kicked the legs and beat it out
Pauline
You left me demonized
You left me demonized
You left me demonized
You left me demonized
For once
Anything that mattered needs to be undone
For once
Everything that matters has to be undone
Pauline
Turned the gun on self belief
Self controls immunity
Values torn to smithereens
PaulineYou left me demonized
You left me demonized
You left me demonized
Pauline
You’re out on your own Pauline
You’re out on your own Pauline
You’re out on your own Pauline
You’re out on your own Pauline
You’re out on your own
