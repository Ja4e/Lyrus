[00:09.36] I hate you for what you did
[00:15.51] And I miss you like a little kid
[00:20.58] I faked it every time, but that's alright
[00:26.87] I can hardly feel anything, I hardly feel anything at all
[00:35.24] 
[00:37.69] You gave me fifteen hundred to see your hypnotherapist
[00:46.81] I only went one time, you let it slide
[00:53.60] Fell on hard times a year ago
[00:56.32] Was hoping you would let it go and you did
[01:01.40] 
[01:03.89] I have emotional motion sickness
[01:08.86] Somebody roll the windows down
[01:12.92] There are no words in the English language
[01:17.93] I could scream to drown you out
[01:23.85] 
[01:27.15] I'm on the outside lookin' through
[01:31.50] You're throwin' rocks around your room
[01:36.11] And while you're bleeding on your back in the glass
[01:43.14] I'll be glad that I made it out
[01:45.50] And sorry that it all went down like it did
[01:53.34] I have emotional motion sickness
[01:58.22] Somebody roll the windows down
[02:02.07] There are no words in the English language
[02:07.21] I could scream to drown you out
[02:12.94] Hey, why do you sing with an English accent?
[02:18.22] I guess it's too late to change it now
[02:22.44] You know I'm never gonna let you have it
[02:27.21] But I will try to drown you out
[02:33.16] 
[02:43.24] You said when you met me you were bored
[02:52.18] You said when you met me you were bored
[02:59.30] And you, you were in a band when I was born
[03:09.48] I have emotional motion sickness
[03:14.38] I try to stay clean and live without
[03:19.45] And I want to know what would happen
[03:23.74] If I surrender to the sound
[03:31.19] Surrender to the sound
[03:34.16]
